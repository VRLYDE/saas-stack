# Ethics Policy

VRLY is committed to ethical excellence in service of our team, customers, and society. Our ethics policy guides us toward a sustainable, fair, and human-centered digital future.

## People and the environment always before profit

We set priorities: People and their environment come before profit. It is important to us that we do not put profit maximization above the basic needs of our team, our customers and society as a whole. We constantly review and adapt our working standards and conditions to ensure the wellbeing of our team. We constantly strive to reduce our environmental impact and promote sustainability in all our business processes.

## Equal opportunities and non-discrimination

We are committed to equal opportunities for all, regardless of gender, age, race, sexual orientation, religion or disability. As a minimum standard, we do not tolerate any form of discrimination, both in the workplace and in our services and products. We also actively promote the rights and freedoms of minority groups, including but not limited to women, lesbian, gay, bi, trans, intersex and asexual persons.

## Solidarity and strength in cooperation

We see our strengths in solidarity and cooperation. On the one hand, this is reflected in our culture of open dialog within the team and with our business partners and customers. On the other hand, in our commitment to a fair and inclusive digital transition.

## Acting with integrity and doing business transparently

We act with exceptional integrity and transparency. We strictly distance ourselves from corrupt business practices and instead focus on sustainable relationships in line with our principles. Any violation of the values documented here will result in appropriate action commensurate with the severity of the violation.

## Environmental protection and sustainability

We recognize our responsibility to the environment and work tirelessly to protect it. This includes the active promotion of green technologies as well as the constant review and improvement of our own processes and the ecological footprint we leave behind.

## Continuous improvement and responsibility

Our team, our customers and our partners have the right and are encouraged to point out ethical missteps. To this end, we have mechanisms in place that allow violations to be reported anonymously and without hindrance. We are also committed to constant self-reflection and further improvements. To this end, we set clear and measurable goals, the fulfillment of which we periodically review and publicly document.
