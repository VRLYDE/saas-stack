### Markdown

These complement Markdownlint.

- **Clarity**: Ensure content is clear, concise, and easy to understand for the intended audience.
- **Structure**: Use headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) logically to structure the document effectively.
- **Formatting**: Use Markdown syntax correctly for lists, code blocks, links, images, tables, emphasis, etc.
- **Links**: Verify that all internal and external links are working, relevant, and accessible.
- **Code Blocks**: Specify the language for syntax highlighting in code blocks (e.g., \`\`\`typescript or \`\`\`sh).
- **Readability**: Break up long paragraphs. Use bolding or italics sparingly and meaningfully for emphasis.
- **READMEs**: Ensure `README.md` files are comprehensive, covering:
  - Project overview and goals.
  - Tech stack.
  - Setup and installation instructions.
  - Development process and scripts.
  - Deployment instructions.
  - Contribution guidelines.
  - Ensure the README aligns with the actual project state.
