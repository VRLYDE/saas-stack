### SQL (for Drizzle Migrations)

- **DDL Statements**: Verify `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `DROP TABLE` statements accurately reflect intended schema changes.
- **DML Statements**: If `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` statements are present (e.g., for data seeding or complex data migrations), ensure they are correct, idempotent if necessary, and performant.
- **Constraints & Indexes**: Check that `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE` constraints, and `INDEX` definitions are correct and align with data relationships and query patterns.
- **Migration Logic**: For Drizzle (or other ORM) generated migration files, review the sequence of operations. Confirm it's logical and handles data transformations correctly if any.
- **Idempotency & Reversibility**: Consider if migrations should be idempotent (safe to run multiple times). If manual down-migrations are needed, they should be carefully crafted.
- **Performance**: Be mindful of potential performance impacts of schema changes or data migrations on large tables.
- **Generated SQL Review**: If generated by a tool like `drizzle-kit`, double-check that the output SQL is as expected and doesn't have unintended consequences.
